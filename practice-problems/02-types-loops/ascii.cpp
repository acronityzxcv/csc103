/* TODO: write a small program that prints an *ASCII table*.  That is,
 * it should print each character along side its numeric representation
 * in the ASCII system: * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii
 * A snippet of sample output might look like this:
 * ...
 * 65 :: A
 * 66 :: B
 * 67 :: C
 * ...
 * NOTE: you can trick cout into printing the ascii value of a character
 * simply by type-casting to integer (or by storing the character in an
 * integer variable and printing that instead).  Also note that the printable
 * range of ASCII values starts at 32 (space) and goes to 126.
